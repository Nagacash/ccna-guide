# Network Fundamentals Module

This module covers the essential concepts of networking that form the foundation of the CCNA certification. You'll learn about network types, components, topologies, and the OSI model.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Identify different types of networks and their characteristics
- Understand network components and their functions
- Describe various network topologies and their advantages
- Explain the OSI and TCP/IP models and their layers
- Understand IP addressing and subnetting basics

## Topics Covered

### 1. Introduction to Networks
- What is a network?
- Types of networks (LAN, WAN, MAN, PAN)
- Client-server and peer-to-peer networks
- Network components (routers, switches, firewalls, etc.)

### 2. Network Topologies
- Bus topology
- Star topology
- Ring topology
- Mesh topology
- Hybrid topology

### 3. The OSI Model
- Physical Layer (Layer 1)
- Data Link Layer (Layer 2)
- Network Layer (Layer 3)
- Transport Layer (Layer 4)
- Session Layer (Layer 5)
- Presentation Layer (Layer 6)
- Application Layer (Layer 7)

### 4. TCP/IP Model
- Network Interface Layer
- Internet Layer
- Transport Layer
- Application Layer

### 5. IP Addressing
- IPv4 vs IPv6
- IP address classes
- Subnetting basics
- Public vs private IP addresses

## Lab Exercises

### Lab 1: Network Device Identification
In this lab, you'll learn to identify different network devices and their functions in a network topology.

### Lab 2: Analyzing Network Traffic
Using Wireshark, you'll capture and analyze network traffic to understand the OSI model in action.

### Lab 3: IP Addressing and Subnetting
Practice IP addressing and subnetting to understand how networks are divided and organized.

### Lab 4: Basic Network Configuration
Configure basic network settings on Cisco devices using the command-line interface.
